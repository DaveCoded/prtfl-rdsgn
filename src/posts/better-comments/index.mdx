## What? Why?

Quite simply, Better Comments is a VS Code extension that helps you to
distinguish between different **kinds** of comment in your code. By using different
styles - mostly colours - you can easily tell the nature of a comment at a glance.
Is it an FYI? Is it a warning? Is it a reminder to clean up that shameful mess later?
To find out, you won't need to read the whole thing if you're using Better Comments.

Since it's easily customised, what categories you want to define for your comments
is completely up to you (and your team), but there are five defaults to give you
an idea of what might be helpful:

### Default comments

Here are all 5 default comments in all their glory:

```js
// todo: replace hardcoded arrays when api is available

// ! Never delete this or our api key will be exposed

// * Used to convert the weird strings in notActuallyJson.js

// ? This works for now but doesn't fit too well with our functional paradigm

// // Necessary polyfill for intersectionObserver
```
